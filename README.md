## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- pystac
- pystac_client
- planetory_computer
- rasterio
- geopands
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip: `pip install pystac pystac_client planetary_computer rasterio geopandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`

## Usage

To use the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells in order. The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations for each step of the process.

## Data

Both the Landsat 5 image and the trainining data is available in the `data` folder.


## Results

The notebook produces a random forest classifier that can predict burned areas on Landsat 5 images with an accuracy of over 85%. The notebook also includes visualizations of the data and the results.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the notebook or would like to contribute to the project, please submit a pull request or open an issue on GitHub.
